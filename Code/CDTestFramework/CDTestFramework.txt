CD Test Framework
=================

This is a very small app used to test various collision detection (CD) algorithms.
It will be first used as a demo/sample for Opcode 1.3 (a lot of people requested this),
and then I will also include benchmarks against competing libraries (Bullet, GIMPACT, etc).

Current version includes tests for:
- sphere vs mesh queries
- OBB vs mesh queries
- capsule vs mesh queries
- complete box pruning
- bipartite box pruning
